This is a tenmplate directoryu structure to use as a starting point for projects. 

It consists of the minimum set of folders and files for any project. 
Specific projects will likely require additional folders and files. 

This README file is meant to be "outward facing," largely for external people 
to know how to navigate the directory.

The "Notes to File" and "Notes" files within each sub-directory are meant to be
"inward-facing," i.e., notes for the project team. 
Accordingly, you may want to add these to .gitignore so that they don't appear
in the public repo.
